# ML-algorithms

Welcome to the "ML-algorithms" repository! This project is a collection of selected machine learning algorithms implemented entirely from scratch in Python, without relying on external libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow. This repository serves as a learning resource and reference for understanding the fundamental principles behind these algorithms.


## Introduction 
Machine learning algorithms are the foundation of modern artificial intelligence and data analysis. Understanding how these algorithms work from the ground up is essential for building robust and efficient machine learning models. This repository aims to provide clear implementations of various machine learning algorithms.

## Structure
Each algorithm is organized into its own directory within this repository. Description of each algorithm can be found in seperate README.md files in their folders.

## Selected algorithms
At this moment repository covers the following algorithms:
- Decision tree
- Random forest
- Evolutionary algorithm
- Neural networks
- Q-learning algorithm
