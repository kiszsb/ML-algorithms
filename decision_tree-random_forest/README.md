# Decision tree and Random Forest
Welcome to the "Decision Tree and Random Forest Implementation" repository! This project provides a comprehensive implementation of a decision tree 
class and a random forest ensemble built from these decision trees, all coded from scratch in Python. This repository aims to offer a clear and 
educational resource for understanding decision tree algorithms and their use in building random forests.

## Introduction
Decision trees are fundamental machine learning models that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. They work by recursively splitting the 
dataset into subsets based on the most informative features. Each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, and each leaf node represents a class 
(for classification) or a numerical value (for regression).

Random forests, on the other hand, are ensemble methods that combine multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and reduce overfitting. This repository 
provides a complete implementation of a decision tree class and demonstrates how these decision trees are used to create a random forest.

## Decition tree

### Description
The decision tree class in this repository is a versatile implementation capable of handling both classification and regression tasks. It constructs a tree by 
selecting the best feature to split the data at each node, based on metrics such as Gini impurity (for classification) or mean squared error (for regression). 
The tree can be customized with various hyperparameters to control its depth, minimum samples per leaf, and more.

### Use cases 
- Classification: The decision tree is suitable for tasks like spam email detection, sentiment analysis, and medical diagnosis.
- Regression: It can predict continuous values, making it useful for applications such as predicting house prices or stock market trends.

## Random forest

### Description
The random forest implementation in this repository leverages the decision tree class to create an ensemble of trees. Random forests introduce randomness by 
considering only a random subset of features when splitting nodes in each tree. The predictions from multiple trees are then aggregated 
(e.g., voting for classification or averaging for regression) to produce a final result.

### Use cases
- Classification: Random forests are effective for image classification, credit scoring, and disease detection.
- Regression: They excel in predicting stock prices, demand forecasting, and real estate price estimation.
- Anomaly Detection: Random forests can also be used for anomaly detection tasks in various domains.
