# Neural networks
Welcome to the "Neural Network Implementation" repository! This project provides a comprehensive implementation of neural networks in Python. Neural networks are a 
fundamental building block of deep learning, a subset of machine learning. This repository aims to serve as a resource for understanding, building, and experimenting 
with neural networks for various machine learning and deep learning tasks.

## Introduction 
The core of this repository is the implementation of artificial neural networks. These networks are designed to simulate the information processing and 
learning capabilities of biological neurons. Key components of this implementation include:
- Neuron Model: A mathematical model for an artificial neuron, including activation functions (e.g., sigmoid, ReLU), weights, and biases.
- Layer Architecture: Support for creating feedforward neural networks with flexible architectures, including specifying the number of hidden layers and neurons
in each layer.
- Forward Propagation: Calculation of the network's output for a given input through a process called forward propagation.
- Backpropagation: Training the network using backpropagation, which involves computing gradients and adjusting weights and biases to minimize a predefined loss function.
- Activation Functions: Support for various activation functions, allowing users to customize network behavior.
- Regularization: Options for adding regularization techniques like dropout and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.

This neural network was created for classification of hand-written numbers from MNIST dataset (https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/datasets/mldata.html). Numbers were encoded
using one-hot encoding.

## Use cases
Neural networks have a wide range of applications across various domains, including:
- Image Classification: Recognizing objects, patterns, and features in images, which is crucial in computer vision tasks like facial recognition and autonomous vehicles.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Processing and understanding human language, used in applications such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, and chatbots.
- Speech Recognition: Converting spoken language into text, used in virtual assistants and transcription services.
- Recommendation Systems: Recommending products, services, or content to users based on their preferences and behavior.
- Anomaly Detection: Identifying unusual or suspicious patterns in data, important for fraud detection and network security.
