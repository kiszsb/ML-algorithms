# Q-Learning algorithm
Welcome to the "Q-Learning Implementation" repository! This project provides a comprehensive implementation of the Q-learning algorithm in Python. 
Q-learning is a fundamental reinforcement learning technique used for solving problems in environments where an agent takes actions to maximize cumulative rewards. 
This repository aims to serve as a resource for understanding, implementing, and experimenting with Q-learning for various reinforcement learning tasks.

## Introduction
Q-learning is reinforcement learning algorithm used for training agents to make sequential decisions that lead to the highest expected cumulative reward. 
It operates by learning a Q-table that stores the expected cumulative rewards (Q-values) for all possible state-action pairs in an environment. Over time, the agent 
explores the environment, updates its Q-table through learning, and uses this knowledge to make decisions.

In presented example algorithm is used for solving frozen lake algorithm. It is using epsilon-greedy strategy. 

## Description
The core of this repository is the implementation of Q-learning. This includes:
- Q-Table: A data structure representing the expected cumulative rewards (Q-values) for all state-action pairs in the environment.
- Exploration vs. Exploitation: Strategies for balancing exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (choosing actions with the highest Q-values).
- Learning Algorithm: The Q-learning algorithm, which updates Q-values based on the Bellman equation and learning rate.
- Environment Interaction: Methods for the agent to interact with the environment, take actions, and receive rewards.
- Training Loop: A training loop that allows the agent to learn from interactions with the environment and update its Q-table.

## Use cases
Q-learning can be applied to a wide range of reinforcement learning tasks, including:
- Robotics: Teaching robots to navigate in an environment, manipulate objects, or perform tasks.
- Game Playing: Creating agents that learn to play games, such as chess, Go, or video games.
- Autonomous Vehicles: Training self-driving cars to make driving decisions based on real-time data.
- Recommendation Systems: Developing recommendation algorithms that learn user preferences and suggest personalized content.
- Resource Allocation: Optimizing resource allocation in dynamic environments, such as energy management or supply chain logistics.
